*Working through Arduino for Dummies

Mostly in review, but I also want to see if it makes more sense now that I am a bit more experienced.
this is cool. my keyboard slowly turns white the longer you text then when you stop...very purple.

// Part 1
/*
~ blink (with LED_BUILTIN)
~ exteral LED Blink (pin13 and gnd)
~ SOS LED signal (Part1>sosSignal.ino)
~ How fast blinking before it looks solid? High 10, Low 13 (a hundredth of a second? I'll do the math later. Walkies time.)

//Part 2 
/*
~ Fade (example> Basics> fade)
~ Fading (example> Analog > fading)
~ PROJECT 1 (Personal): The Lights Game (PDF page 99)     ***** UPDATES FOR LATER. File's comments for more info.
~ Did every example up until... (Motors. The Servos were busy, and I need a new Diode and PNP Transistor.)
~ Skipped DC Hobby Motor lesson and Servo lesson, although, I did read through them.
~ Piezo Lesson
~ PROJECT 2 (Personal): Tune_GoYourOwnWay  ...Was going to convert the song from kalimba tabs, but holy that just seems like too much right now. I am almost done the more original parts, just need to change timings for other parts after this. I am not in the mood to piece that together right now, but I intend to someday. First bit up-to-chorus and 2/3 of chorus done. I need to not hear the song for a bit.
